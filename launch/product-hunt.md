## Maker Comment

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built KryptoTrac after getting frustrated with existing crypto trackers that require exchange API access and store sensitive data.

As a Canadian crypto investor, I wanted something that:
- Respects privacy (no account linking)
- Shows prices in CAD
- Makes tax time easier
- Looks beautiful and feels fast

KryptoTrac does all that. It's been my daily driver for tracking Bitcoin, Ethereum, and my altcoin portfolio.

**What makes it different:**
- Your holdings data stays on your device
- No exchange account linking required
- AI insights powered by the latest models
- Built specifically with Canadians in mind

I'd love your feedback! What features matter most to you in a portfolio tracker?

Thanks for checking it out!
