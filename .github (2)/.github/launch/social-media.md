Most portfolio trackers want API keys to your exchange accounts.

That's a massive security risk.

**Launching KryptoTrac: A Privacy-First Crypto Portfolio Tracker**

After 6 months of development, I'm excited to launch KryptoTrac - a modern cryptocurrency portfolio tracker built for privacy-conscious Canadian investors.

**The Problem:**
Existing crypto trackers require exchange API access, creating security vulnerabilities and privacy concerns. For Canadians, most tools lack CAD pricing and tax-ready exports.

**The Solution:**
KryptoTrac tracks prices, not your personal data. Your holdings never leave your device. No exchange linking required.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time price updates from CoinGecko
- AI-powered portfolio insights
- Smart price alerts
- Tax export functionality
- CAD pricing built-in
- Beautiful, fast interface

**Tech Stack:**
Next.js 16, React 19, Supabase, Stripe, AI SDK, Tailwind CSS

**Business Model:**
Freemium - generous free tier with Pro features ($9.99 CAD/month) for advanced users. Transparent affiliate partnerships with exchanges.
