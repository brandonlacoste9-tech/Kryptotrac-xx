**Title:** Show HN: KryptoTrac – Privacy-first crypto portfolio tracker (Next.js, AI)

**Body:**

Hey HN!

I built KryptoTrac - a cryptocurrency portfolio tracker that doesn't require exchange API access.

**Why I built this:**

Most crypto trackers ask for exchange API keys, which always felt like a security risk. I wanted something that tracks prices without storing sensitive data.

**How it works:**

- Users manually input their holdings (coin + quantity)
- We fetch real-time prices from CoinGecko every 30 seconds
- Holdings data stays in the browser/database with RLS policies
- No exchange account linking required

**Tech Stack:**

- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- React 19 with Server Components
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + RLS)
- Stripe for subscriptions
- AI SDK for portfolio insights
- Tailwind CSS v4

**Features:**

- Real-time price tracking (100+ coins)
- Portfolio value calculations
- Smart price alerts
- AI-powered insights (Pro)
- Performance analytics
- Tax export (CSV/PDF)

**Business Model:**

Freemium - free tier is generous, Pro tier ($9.99 CAD/month) adds AI insights, unlimited alerts, and advanced analytics.

**Canadian Focus:**

Built specifically for Canadian crypto investors with CAD pricing, tax exports, and Canadian exchange recommendations.
